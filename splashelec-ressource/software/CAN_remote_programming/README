This directory contains everything to reprogramm (reflash) 
distant CANinterfacer nodes connected to the CAN bus.

One extra CANinterfacer (or Arduino with CAN shield) 
serves as USB programming interface and must be charged with 
the "CAN_remote_programmer" sketch.

The "bootloader_mcp2515" is installed on each of the CANinterfacers 
of the bus. Each one gets a unique identifier set at compilation 
(see README in the bootloader_mcp2515 directory).

And finally a connected host PC can be used to transfer 
compiled sketches using the "bootloader_python" program.
