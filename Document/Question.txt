- Le cable CAN alimente il les autre noeud du réseaux?
Le bus CAN sur le schema electrique correspond au connecteur 104, ce connecteur est composé de
2 GND, le CANL et CANH, et le port VIN de la carte arduino.

Power

The Arduino Leonardo can be powered via the micro USB connection or with an external power supply. The power source is selected automatically.

External (non-USB) power can come either from an AC-to-DC adapter (wall-wart) or battery. The adapter can be connected by plugging a 2.1mm center-positive plug into the board's power jack.
Leads from a battery can be inserted in the Gnd and Vin pin headers of the POWER connector.

The board can operate on an external supply of 6 to 20 volts. If supplied with less than 7V, however, the 5V pin may supply less than five volts and the board may be unstable. 
If using more than 12V, the voltage regulator may overheat and damage the board. The recommended range is 7 to 12 volts.

The power pins are as follows:

    VIN. The input voltage to the Arduino board when it's using an external power source 
			(as opposed to 5 volts from the USB connection or other regulated power source).
			You can supply voltage through this pin, or, if supplying voltage via the power jack, access it through this pin.
    5V. The regulated power supply used to power the microcontroller and other components on the board. 
		This can come either from VIN via an on-board regulator, or be supplied by USB or another regulated 5V supply.
    3V3. A 3.3 volt supply generated by the on-board regulator. Maximum current draw is 50 mA.
    GND. Ground pins.
    IOREF. The voltage at which the i/o pins of the board are operating (i.e. VCC for the board). This is 5V on the Leonardo.
